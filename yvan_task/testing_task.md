# Testing Task: Strengthening the Neotix Backend Codebase

## Overview
Welcome to your first task at Neotix! Our team has been moving fast to build out our GPU listings backend, and now it's time to ensure our codebase is robust and reliable. Your mission is to implement comprehensive tests for each module while learning to leverage AI-assisted development using Windsurf.

## Background
Our codebase is a Flask-based backend that aggregates GPU listings from various providers. Key components include:
- GPU data fetching and caching system
- Database models for GPU listings and configurations
- REST API endpoints for querying and managing GPU data
- Authentication and user management
- Analytics tracking

## Your Task

### 1. Environment Setup (Day 1)
- Review the README.md for setup instructions
- Set up your local development environment
- Ensure you can run the application locally
- Familiarize yourself with the test files we've created

### 2. Testing Implementation (Days 2-6)
You'll need to implement tests for the following modules:

#### Commands
- `test_fetch_gpu_data.py`: Test GPU data fetching command
  - Test successful data fetching
  - Test error handling
  - Test data validation

#### Routes
- `test_auth_routes.py`: Authentication endpoints
- `test_user_routes.py`: User management
- `test_gpu_routes.py`: GPU listing endpoints
  - Focus on query parameters
  - Test filtering and sorting
  - Test error cases

#### Utils
- `test_gpu_data_fetcher.py`: Core GPU data fetching
  - Test provider integration
  - Test data transformation
  - Test error handling
- `test_cache.py`: Caching system
  - Test cache hits/misses
  - Test expiration
  - Test invalidation

### 3. Documentation and Review (Day 7)
- Document any failing tests
- Propose improvements for failing components
- Submit a comprehensive report of your findings

## Important Notes

### Using Windsurf
A crucial part of this exercise is learning to effectively use the Windsurf code editor and its AI capabilities. Some tips:
- Ask the AI about code structure and functionality
- Use AI to help generate test cases
- Let AI assist in debugging failing tests
- Learn to phrase questions effectively to get the best responses

### Learning Objectives
1. **Incomplete Information Handling**: You'll encounter scenarios where documentation is minimal. Use this as an opportunity to:
   - Practice reading and understanding code
   - Learn to ask effective questions to the AI
   - Develop problem-solving skills with partial information

2. **AI-Assisted Development**: Actively use Windsurf's AI capabilities to:
   - Understand existing code
   - Generate test cases
   - Debug issues
   - Learn best practices

### Working Process
1. All work should be done in the `yvan_tests` branch
2. Commit your changes frequently with descriptive messages
3. Use the AI to understand any unclear parts of the codebase
4. Document any assumptions you make

### Success Criteria
By the end of the week, you should have:
1. Implemented tests for all major components
2. Achieved high test coverage
3. Documented any failing tests with:
   - Reason for failure
   - Proposed fixes
   - Impact assessment

## Getting Help
- Use Windsurf's AI capabilities as your first line of support
- Document questions that the AI couldn't answer clearly
- Focus on learning how to effectively communicate with the AI

## CI/CD Implementation

A critical part of this testing task is implementing a robust CI/CD pipeline. You will need to:

1. Research and choose appropriate CI/CD tools (e.g., GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Jenkins)
2. Design and implement a pipeline that:
   - Automatically runs all tests on each commit
   - Performs code quality checks
   - Generates test coverage reports
   - Manages deployments effectively

This is entirely your responsibility to research, design, and implement. The goal is to demonstrate your ability to:
- Set up automated testing infrastructure
- Implement industry best practices for continuous integration
- Ensure code quality through automated checks
- Document your CI/CD implementation decisions

Take initiative in exploring different CI/CD solutions and choose what you think works best for this project. This is an opportunity to showcase your DevOps skills and understanding of modern development practices.

Good luck! Start by setting up your environment and don't hesitate to ask the AI any questions you have along the way.
